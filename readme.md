## Upcoming Features (v0.2.0 alpha)
- [ ] Add organism behavior mechanism
- Animal can try new behavior; If behavior results in more food, water, or offspring, then animal can "learn" behavior and try it again
- If behavior is learned, then it can be passed down (epigenetic mutation)
- [ ] Add subspecies detection
- If species has more than 50 points of variation compared to its given species, create new subspecies of that species

## Future Update Ideas
- [ ] Dead orgnanism utilization
- Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
- Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
- [ ] Add pack behavior simulation
- [ ] Add dynamic weather and seasons
