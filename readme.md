- Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
- [ ] Allow user to reset and re-enter organisms in the environment
- [ ] Add rename function in application console
- Renames all organisms with given species name and updates parent species information

## Future Update Ideas
- [ ] Add pack behavior simulation
- [ ] Add dynamic weather and seasons
- [ ] Add organism behavior mechanism
- Animal can try new behavior; If behavior results in more food, water, or offspring, then animal can "learn" behavior and try it again
- If behavior is learned, then it can be passed down (epigenetic mutation)
- [ ] Add save feature to simulation
- Any new species created during simulation are stored in output
- Also tracks extinct species
- [ ] Add transfer saved organisms feature to environment
- Transfers new organisms from output to the user list of organism
- [ ] Calculate species fitness based on what percent did not die due to natural causes
