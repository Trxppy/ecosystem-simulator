## Upcoming Features (v0.2.0 alpha)
- [X] Add subspecies detection
- If species has more than 50 points of variation compared to its given species, create new subspecies of that species
- Add parent species to savedata and include as an attribute
- [ ] Add rename function in application console
- Renames all organisms with given species name and updates parent species information
- [] Add foundation for animal classification
- [ ] Add animal fin size variable that works in parallel to wing size variable
- Wing size variable will now only work on terrestrial animals
- For aquatic animals, fin size works the same as wing size var
- [ ] Add environmental boundaries for terrestrial/aquatic animals
- Aquatic animals can't search for food/water/mates outside of water and vice versa for terrestrial animals

## Future Update Ideas
- [ ] Dead orgnanism utilization
- Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
- Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
- [ ] Add pack behavior simulation
- [ ] Add dynamic weather and seasons
- [ ] Add organism behavior mechanism
- Animal can try new behavior; If behavior results in more food, water, or offspring, then animal can "learn" behavior and try it again
- If behavior is learned, then it can be passed down (epigenetic mutation)
