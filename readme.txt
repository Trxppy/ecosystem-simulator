To-Do List:

5. Add genetic variations in offspring of plants and animals
-For plants: Variable min_moisture, max_height

5.1. Add excess water capacity variable to plants and add variation to it.

7. Add generation variable to animals and plants

8. Add mutations
-Add random mutation when spawning first generation of species of animals and plants

9. Add pack behavior simulation

10. Add acquired tastes mechanism to carnivores
-If organism eats enough of another organism, add prey item to acquired tastes

11. Use excess water in plants as minor source of water

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
