To-Do List:

MINOR UPDATES
1. Consolidate animal/plant spawn in console DONE
2. Add excess water capacity variable to plants and add variation to it. WORKING

MAJOR FUTURE UPDATES
1. Add mutations
-Add random mutation when spawning first generation of species of animals and plants
2. Add genetic variations in offspring of plants and animals
-For plants: Variable min_moisture, max_height
3. Use excess water in plants as minor source of water (if correct mutation is present)
4. Add pack behavior simulation
5. Add acquired tastes mechanism to carnivores
-If organism eats enough of another organism, add prey item to acquired tastes

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
1. Dead orgnanism utilization
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
