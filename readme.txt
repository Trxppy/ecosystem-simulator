To-Do List:

2. Add reproductive functionality for plants DONE
-If plant has maximum height and health, create identical new plant on adjacent empty tile DONE
-Add size var to plants (between 0.1 and 1)
-Add occupied space var to block; If occupied space == 1, then no more plants can be added to that block

3. Randomize lifespan and max_height to be (+/-) 5

4. Add animal organisms

5. Fragment output
-Creat output folder
-Empty the folder contents when new environment is created
-Every day of simulation, create new folder (ex. 'day1.txt')

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
