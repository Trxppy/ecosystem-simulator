To-Do List:

4. Add animal organisms

5. Add genetic variations in offspring of plants and animals
-For plants: Variable min_moisture, max_height

6. Add max health for plants (instead of default 100 variable)
-Set initial health equal to max health

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
