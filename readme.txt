To-Do List:

MINOR UPDATES
1. Consolidate animal/plant spawn in console DONE
2. Add excess water capacity variable to plants and add variation to it. DONE

MAJOR FUTURE UPDATES
1. Add mutations IN PROGRESS
-Create plant mutation generator (allows user to add mutations and incompatible mutations)
-Add random mutation when spawning first generation of species of animals and plants
2. Add genetic variations in offspring of plants and animals
-For plants: Variable min_moisture, max_height
3. Use excess water in plants as minor source of water (if correct mutation is present)
4. Add pack behavior simulation
5. Add acquired tastes mechanism to carnivores
-If organism eats enough of another organism, add prey item to acquired tastes
6. Add behaiors
-works similarly to mutations-> Animal can try new behavior; If behavior results in more food, water, or offspring, then animal can "learn" behavior and try it again
-If behavior is learned, then it can be passed down (epigenetic mutation)
7. Add environment temperature variable
8. Add wing dize variable
-Mutate in increments of 0.1
-If wing size reaches 5, animal can glide (movement increases 20%)
-If wing size reaches 25, animal can fly (movement increases 50%)

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
1. Dead orgnanism utilization
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
