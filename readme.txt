To-Do List:

1. Add lifespan [static] and age [dynamic]  for plant objects (in days)
- When max lifespan is reached, plant is deleted (handled by environment; check for plants which have lifespans less than or equal to their age)

2. Add reproductive functionality for plants
-If plant has maximum height and health, create identical new plant on adjacent empty tile

3. Randomize lifespan and max_height to be (+/-) 5
