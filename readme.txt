To-Do List:

2. Add reproductive functionality for plants
-If plant has maximum height and health, create identical new plant on adjacent empty tile

3. Randomize lifespan and max_height to be (+/-) 5

4. Add animal organisms

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
