To-Do List:

V0.1 BETA
1. Round variation numbers to two digits DONE
2. Add wing size variable DONE
-Mutate in increments of 0.1
-If wing size reaches 5, animal can glide (movement increases 20%)
-If wing size reaches 25, animal can fly (movement increases 50%)

V0.2 BETA
6. Add behaiors
-animal can try new behavior; If behavior results in more food, water, or offspring, then animal can "learn" behavior and try it again
-If behavior is learned, then it can be passed down (epigenetic mutation)
7. Add subspecies detection
-If species has more than 50 points of variation compared to its given species, create new subspecies of that species

POSSIBLE FUTURE UPDATE IDEAS
1. Dead orgnanism utilization
-Dead organisms are not deleted and can be eaten by other organisms
-Dead plants can be used as shelter habitat for animals
2. Add pack behavior simulation
3. Add dynamic weather and seasons
